# NTNU_LATEX_SLIDES

Contains necessary files for creating slides in powerpoint format in latex for NTNU. You may encounter problems beyond the scope of what readme-files (and/or similiar) will deal with. Use google if you find yourself with errors. And also, it should be needless to say and should not give you any problems, but still, you use this at your own risk. 

Currently works for Windows. Will most likely be similar for MAC OS and LINUX users. This repo contains information from several other sources, and should be sufficient in creating a "slideshow". Use of the example code may be advantageous.

# Recommendations: 
1) Use MiKTex 2.9 (other versions have not been tested)
2) Use TexStudio as the tex editor (other editors have not been tested)
